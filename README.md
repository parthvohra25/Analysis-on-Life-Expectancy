# Life Expectancy Dashboard
This repository contains a data dashboard created using real-life datasets to analyze and visualize various parameters affecting life expectancy in different countries from the year 2000 to 2015. The primary goal of this project is to calculate the life expectancy measure based on factors such as death rate and alcohol consumption for individual countries or collectively for all countries within the specified time frame.

## Overview
Life expectancy is a critical indicator of the overall health and well-being of a population. Understanding the factors that influence life expectancy can provide valuable insights into public health and policy decisions. This dashboard aims to facilitate data-driven analysis and decision-making by allowing users to explore and interact with the data.

### Features
The Life Expectancy Dashboard provides the following key features:

* **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize trends in life expectancy, death rate, and alcohol consumption over the years 2000 to 2015.

* **Country Selection**: Users can choose specific countries to analyze individually or select all countries to view collective data.

* **Time Range Selection**: The ability to filter data within the specified time frame (2000 to 2015).

* **Life Expectancy Calculation**: A built-in mechanism to calculate life expectancy based on the selected parameters and time frame.

## Data Sources

The dashboard utilizes real-life datasets on life expectancy, death rate, and alcohol consumption, which are essential factors influencing life expectancy. These datasets are collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) and are available on Kaggle. The data has been preprocessed for analysis.

### Getting Started
To get started with the Life Expectancy Dashboard, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need to set up a R environment with the required libraries.

Run the Tableau software to start exploring the data and calculating life expectancy based on your chosen parameters.

### Usage
Once the dashboard is running, you can use the user-friendly interface to select countries, specify the time frame, and analyze the impact of death rate and alcohol consumption on life expectancy.
